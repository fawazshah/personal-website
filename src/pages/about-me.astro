    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>👨‍💻 I'm a full-stack engineer, keen on solving hard problems and delivering quality, reliable features to users. I'm also very passionate about good communication and public speaking skills.</p>
    <p>📈 I currently work at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/values/tech-at-bloomberg/" target=_blank">Bloomberg LP</a> in the Index ESG Data team, focusing on ingestion of millions of ESG datapoints in a fast and fault-tolerant way. I use C# and React/Typescript, working with Postgres for data storage.</p>
    <p>🎓 Before this, I studied Joint Maths & Computing at Imperial College London, graduating in 2021 with First Class Honours. I helped run <a href="https://ichack.org/" target="_blank">IC Hack</a>, one of the largest hackathons in the country, and also studied Japanese for 2 years!</p>
